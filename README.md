# Project Illustration:

The project aims to create a classic game named as "TRIPLE CHALLENGE SHOWDOWN" using C programming language which includes three games, Tic Tac Toe, Guessing The Number and Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spork. Firstly, and most importantly, the user will be asked to choose any 1 of the tree mentioned games.

## TIC TAC TOE:
First and foremost, in Tic Tac Toe the user can play against a computer or against a person which is based upon the user's choice. After that, the user can choose the difficulty level to determine how easy or hard they want the game to be. While playing against a computer if he picks an easy level, there will be a possibility that he might win, However, if he chooses hard then either he will lose, or the game will be drawn.
Moreover, if the game is being played against the computer, the user will make their choice, and the computer will. The computer's move completely depends upon some functions and the mini-max algorithm. In this case, either the computer will win the game, or it will end in a draw. However, when the game is being played between two people, both of them will make their choices sequentially, and one of them will win the game. 

## ROCK PAPER SCISSOR LIZARD SPOCK:
Basically, in this game, the user can choose among these 5 options (mainly Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spork). Afterward, the user will make his choice, and then accordingly the computer will choose using a random function. Then the winner will be chosen using some functions. Either user will win or lose.

## GUESSIG THE NUMBER:
Firstly, the computer will generate a number between 1-100 randomly using a function. Thereafter, the user will be asked to input his guesses this process will continue untill the user guesses correctly. When the user successfully guesses the 
number, he'll win the game. The screen will also display the number of attempts made by the user in order to guess the number.
